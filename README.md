go-orrery-example
====================

For a long time, basically since the beginning of Java, I've used a
simple orrery program as my ``Hello World'' for any new programming
language, particularly an OO one.

This is sucn an exercise for Go.  This is one of my first and only Go
programs. 


To run
======

    go run orrery.go

or

    go build orrery.go
    ./orrery
    ./orrery --help
